    <p>
        Iâ€™m a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, 
        passionate about building tools that combine technology and psychology 
        to promote effective learning and academic success. 
        I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University
        and specialize in Full-Stack, Frontend, Backend, Android, and ML infrastructure development.
